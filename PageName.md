# SIGCHI Conference Template #

A thread of discussion started by Paul André on Google+ discussed issues with the current template. I include the text more or less verbatim here.

# Paul André: Rethinking the ACM Conference Template #

Many people have recently (and no doubt long before I got here) been discussing, critiquing, and suggesting improvements to the arguably outdated ACM (SIGCHI) conference template. Let's collate those suggestions and actually create something new! Both simple and substantial changes below.

1) One-column. The two-column format has a certain aesthetic appeal, but is a pain to read/navigate on screen. Move to one column?

2) References. Due to page limitations, relevant refs get left out, and authors spend hours tweaking conference names or font size. References should not be included in paper length. At the very least, a (small) font size should be mandated, so authors are not left wondering if they'll get sanctioned for playing with size. (Others have also suggested hyperlinks, footnotes, or Harvard style referencing.)

3) General Terms. Are these at all useful? And ACM Classification Keywords?

4) THE FUTURE. Apparently some "hypertext" field used to be a big deal. Let's use it. DOIs can be linked. Videos embedded in the document. What else? Variable length limits?

These are just some of the suggestions had in discussion with others. What would you like to see changed? What templates from other venues do you lust after?
